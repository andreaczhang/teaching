# Day 4

flow: this day is focused on categorical outcome, and tests about them. Only cover binary outcomes. introduce one group, two groups in the morning; then continue more than two groups in the afternoon.



### <span style = 'color:tomato'>Analysis of proportions I</span> 8:30-9:20 (50m)

- motivating examples of binary outcome analysis (for the day): why it is VERY useful

##### Proportions, binomial distribution 30m 

- binary outcome, proportion, probability 5m
- in order to get the sampling distribution, we recall binomial distribution 15m  <span style = 'color:orange'>be clear about population and sample proportion, and their uncertainty. This should be the most tricky thing to explain</span>
- Example 10m 

##### Testing a hypothesis about one proportion 20m

- revision of hypo testing: what it is, why do we need it, how to construct it 5m <span style = 'color:orange'>especially, under the null hypothesis, and distinguish observed test statistic</span>
- test of one prop 10m
- Example 10m





### <span style = 'color:tomato'>Analysis of proportions II</span> 9:30-10:30 (60m)

##### Two proportions 15m

- what and why <span style = 'color:orange'>define risk factor, population in this case</span>
- 2 by 2 contingency (with example) <span style = 'color:orange'>difference from confusion matrix</span>

##### Comparing two proportions and test

- relative risk 15
- odds ratio 15
- risk difference (less focus) 5
- some remarks on RR and OR 5



### <span style = 'color:tomato'>Table analysis I</span> 13:00-13:45 (45m)

##### 2 by 2 table continued 35m

motivate that this is another way to analyse 2 by 2

- Chi sq test 20m
- example, then logic 
- exact test 10m
- example
- some remarks on validity

##### larger contingency tables 10m

- chi sq test stat (larger tables)
- Example



### <span style = 'color:tomato'>Table analysis II</span> 13:45-14:15 (30m)

##### remark on the chi-sq and exact tests 10m

##### stata example 20m
