# 4.25 Tuesday 8:30-11:30

Session 1: introduction to R (45 min)

Session 2: descriptive statistics 

- theory, types of visualisation (15 min)
- guided exercise 30-40 min (use exercise 1)

Practice

- use lung data (maybe guide half)
- let them try 
- lung data is going to be explored on t-test day 
- hospital los exercise (ex3), might not have time to do in class



### <span style = 'color:blue'>TO DO</span>



- might need to make backup csv files, some people might have problem using `haven` package 
- focus a lot on interpretation
- should I do 'curve' (normal) for the histogram at this point?
- would be very useful if they understand filtering based on another variable (data[data2 == 'true'])
- mean(with NA)





# 4.27 Thursday 8:30-11:30

Session 1: statistical inference (CI) theory recap (30 min) <span style = 'color:red'>this part is usually difficult to grasp</span>

- heart example

Session 2: t-tests

- lung data (exercise has 7 questions)
- need to make sure that they have learnt all types of t-tests and CI 

Practice

- half lung example 



### <span style = 'color:blue'>TO DO</span>

- be careful with the variance formula, standard error of mean, standard deviation of data
- quantile of normal distribution, t-dist
- qqplot 



# 4.28 Friday 8:30-11:30

Session 1: categorical analysis recap, different metrics (30 min) 

Session 2: table analysis (45 min)

- lung data, including coding data
- interpretation of results

Practice 60 min - 75 min

- Birth data, this is a complete analysis, give them more time to do this



Wrap up week 1



### <span style = 'color:blue'>TO DO</span>

# 5.8 Monday 9-12

Session 1: EDA

Session 2: transformation, non-parametric tests 

Session 3: lab
